Users can enter their monthly income which acts as the base for budgeting.

-  Vegetables & Groceries
-  Personal Needs
-  Transport

It automatically adds all the expenses and shows:
- Total Spent Amount

- Helps maintain budget discipline

If expenses are within limits:
- Shows "You are budgeting perfectly!" message


The app checks:
- If savings ≥ 20% → Perfect Saver   
- If savings < 20% → Suggests how to save more  


- Monthly savings goal  
- How much to save every month
